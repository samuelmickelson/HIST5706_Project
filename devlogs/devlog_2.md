#### Updates

* Visited MacOdrum Library on Tuesday, November 9. Cartographic librarian Sherri Sunstrum had put a collection of maps out for me to have a look at. There were maps of Champlain's voyages, maps of the fur trade in Canada, maps of the Ottawa River, etc. All useful for the bigger picture of my research, but there were no specific maps of Ottawa and/or the Chaudiere Falls. These maps are housed in the Ottawa Resource Collection at the MacOdrum Library.
* I still need to browse the Ottawa Resource Collection online and make an appointment to view a selection of maps that might be useful for my research. For my HIST 5706 project, however, I will work with digitized and publicly available maps available through Library and Archive's Canada online database. I know that there are many digitized maps of Ottawa and/or the Chaudiere Falls available through LAC.
* I had a video call with Dr. Graham on Monday, November 8. This was super helpful. I learned about many other digital mapping and visual storytelling tools in addition to Google Earth (e.g. Leaflet.js, Mural)
* I worked through the Leaflet.js tutorial on the course website. I got tripped up at Step 8 which asks you to use a bit of Python code to set up a webserver. I didn't have Python installed on my computer so I used a tutorial on the Programming Historian to get it installed. I ran into some difficulty doing this, however, and ultimately [posted for help on the Discord server for the course](https://discordapp.com/channels/693526681297748090/872190995696062547/911671662838169600).
* Jeff Blackadar offered to help me troubleshoot so we had a video call where I was able to share my screen with him. It turned out that the issue was in how I had installed Python on my computer. Thank you, Jeff.
* I later figured out--also through the Leaflet tutorial I believe--that I can also render the Leaflet maps using GitHub Pages.
* With the webserver issue resolved, I was able to finish working through the Leaflet tutorial. It's very cool to see what Leaflet can do and to consider all of the possibilities in terms of functionality, plugins, etc. The folder housing all of the files that I created during the tutorial is [available here](https://github.com/samuelmickelson/samuelmickelson.github.io/tree/main/leafletdemo)

#### Next steps

* Identify and download some historical maps and/or images of Ottawa/the Chaudiere Falls through the LAC online database.
* Use Leaflet and related tools (e.g. OpenStreetMaps, MapWarper) to build an interactive map that represents how uses of the Chaudiere Falls have changed over time.
* Share map on Discord server during the week of November 29.
