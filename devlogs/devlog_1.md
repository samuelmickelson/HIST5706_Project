##### Progress to date

During the Digital Tune Up section of the course, I had grand ambitions to learn and experiment with a variety of digital mapping technologies. Alas, life happened and I got swamped with other work and then decided to take a much-needed few days off from work during fall reading week. The upshot is that I was only able to complete the [StoryMaps.js tutorial](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/39beccc2549af720c8ef09ba08e9ca39/the-shifting-uses-of-the-chaudiere-falls/index.html) and a small portion of the QGIS 4 Arch tutorial before it was time to shift my focus to building a prototype for Module 3 of the course. Feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the task ahead of me, it was a huge relief to meet with GIS librarian Rebecca Bartlett and cartographic specialist Sherri Sunstrum this past Thursday, November 4. This meeting helped me think through what seems most feasible given the time constraints of this course and how my work over the next few weeks could feed into my broader MA research.

I have decided that I will work with Google Earth to do some exploratory historical GIS work focused on the changing uses of the Chaudiere Falls over time. This feels a lot more manageable to me than scrambling to get proficient enough in QGIS so that I can build something before the end of the term. Working with Google Earth will allow me to develop some basic proficiency in GIS concepts and tools, and I will be able to build a prototype that can serve as a foundation for future historical GIS work on the Chaudiere Falls. I got the idea to use Google Earth from a chapter in *Historical GIS Research in Canada* about [a project that used Google Earth to map the history of the St. Lawrence Seaway and Welland Canals](https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/49926/UofCPress_HistoricalGIS_2014_Chapter02.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y). As for QGIS, now that I have dipped my toes in the water I feel like I am on track to learn it over the coming months.  

My next step is a meeting this Tuesday with Sherri Sunstrum and Monica Ferguson, coordinator of the Ottawa Resource Collection, to review maps and other cartographic materials related to the Chaudiere Falls housed at the MacOdrum Library. I imagine that the library will have a combination of digitized and undigitized materials. Once I have selected a few maps, I can start experimenting with Google Earth. The MacOdrum Library has [a webpage](https://library.carleton.ca/guides/help/georeferencing-and-digitizing-scanned-maps-or-aerial-images-google-earth) on georeferencing and digitizing scanned maps or aerial images in Google Earth which should come in pretty handy. By the end of Week 9, I plan to have selected my dataset and to have begun working with it using Google Earth.
